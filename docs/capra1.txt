Penelope was not like other goats. Her herd loved lounging on the cool wooden benches scattered around the farm, chewing their cud and gossiping about the juiciest patch of clover. Penelope, however, would bleat in terror at the mere sight of one. Benches, to her, were monstrous, lumbering beasts with silent, waiting backs.

It all started on a sunny afternoon when Penelope, still a wobbly kid, had tripped and fallen right into the lap of Farmer John, who was relaxing on a bench. The sudden sensation, combined with the unfamiliar scent of pipe tobacco, had sent her heart into a frantic gallop. Since then, benches had become the objects of her deepest fear.

This fear, however, caused Penelope much inconvenience. During playtime, her friends would gather on a bench for a chat, leaving her feeling excluded. When the farmer sat down to read under a shady tree, Penelope would be forced to stand awkwardly at a distance, her lunch forgotten.

One day, her best friend, a wise old goat named Bartholomew, sat down on a bench with a sigh. Penelope, as usual, stood a few feet away, nibbling at some grass.

"Penelope, why do you stay so far away?" Bartholomew asked gently.

Penelope bleated hesitantly, "I... I'm scared of the bench."

Bartholomew chuckled, his beard twitching as he did. "But Penelope, benches are harmless. They're just for sitting!"

Penelope lowered her head. "I know, but..."

Seeing her friend's distress, Bartholomew hatched a plan. He started by positioning himself a good distance away from a bench, talking to Penelope in a soothing voice. Slowly, over several days, he inched closer, Penelope following cautiously.

Finally, they stood right beside the bench. Penelope's hooves trembled, and she squeezed her eyes shut. Bartholomew, sensing her fear, nudged her gently with his head.

"Just a tiny step, Penelope," he encouraged. "You can do it."

Taking a deep breath, Penelope lifted one hoof and placed it gingerly on the edge of the bench. It didn't move, it didn't roar, it simply stayed there. Emboldened, she placed the other hoof next to it, then slowly lowered herself onto the cool wood.

She bleated in surprise, expecting a sudden attack. But there was none. Instead, a wave of relief washed over her. Sitting beside Bartholomew, she felt a warmth spread through her, replacing the fear with a sense of accomplishment.

From that day on, Penelope was no longer afraid of benches. She joined her friends for their chats, relished the shade on a hot day, and even learned to climb onto the highest bench in the farm, surveying her world with a newfound confidence. The benches, once terrifying monsters, became friendly companions, a testament to her courage and the power of friendship.
