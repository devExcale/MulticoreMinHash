Franca wasn't like the other goats. While her herd loved sprawling on the cool wooden benches scattered around the farm, bleating gossip and chewing their cud, Franca would bleat in terror at their sight. Benches, to her, were monstrous, silent giants with waiting, wooden backs.

It all started on a sunny afternoon when Franca, still a wobbly kid, had tripped and fallen right onto the lap of Farmer John, who was enjoying a pipe on his bench. The sudden movement, combined with the unfamiliar scent of tobacco, had sent her heart into a frantic gallop. Since then, benches had become the objects of her deepest fear.

This fear, however, caused Franca much inconvenience. During playtime, her friends would gather for a chat on the benches, leaving her feeling excluded. When the farmer sat down to read under a shady tree, Franca would be forced to stand awkwardly at a distance, her lunch forgotten.

One day, her best friend, a wise old goat named Pippobaudo, sat down on a bench with a sigh. Franca, as usual, stood a few feet away, nibbling at some grass.

"Franca, why do you stay so far away?" Pippobaudo asked gently.

Franca bleated hesitantly, "I... I'm scared of the bench."

Pippobaudo chuckled, his beard twitching as he did. "But Franca, benches are harmless. They're just for sitting!"

Franca lowered her head. "I know, but..."

Seeing his friend's distress, Pippobaudo hatched a plan. He started by positioning himself a good distance away from a bench, talking to Franca in a soothing voice. Slowly, over several days, he inched closer, Franca following cautiously.

Finally, they stood right beside the bench. Franca's hooves trembled, and she squeezed her eyes shut. Pippobaudo, sensing her fear, nudged her gently with his head.

"Just a tiny step, Franca," he encouraged. "You can do it."

Taking a deep breath, Franca lifted one hoof and placed it gingerly on the edge of the bench. It didn't move, it didn't roar, it simply stayed there. Emboldened, she placed the other hoof next to it, then slowly lowered herself onto the cool wood.

She bleated in surprise, expecting a sudden attack. But there was none. Instead, a wave of relief washed over her. Sitting beside Pippobaudo, she felt a warmth spread through her, replacing the fear with a sense of accomplishment.

From that day on, Franca was no longer afraid of benches. She joined her friends for their chats, relished the shade on a hot day, and even learned to climb onto the highest bench in the farm, surveying her world with a newfound confidence. The benches, once terrifying giants, became friendly companions, a testament to her courage and the power of friendship.
